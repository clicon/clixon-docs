Overview
========

Clixon is a management framework that can be used by networking
devices and other computer systems.  Clixon provides a datastore, CLI,
NETCONF and RESTCONF interfaces all defined by YANG.

  - `Project <http://www.clicon.org>`_.
  - `Docs <https://clixon-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Most of the projects using Clixon are for networking devices. But Clixon
can be used for other YANG-based systems as well due to a modular and
pluggable architecture.

Clixon has a transaction mechanism that ensures configuration
operations are atomic. It also features a generated interactive
command-line interface using `CLIgen <http://www.cligen.se>`_.

The goal of Clixon is to provide a useful, production-grade, scalable
and free YANG based configuration tool.

System Architecture
-------------------

Clixon provides YANG functionality with Netconf, Restconf and CLI that
can be integrated with a "base system" in several ways. Two primary integrations are outlined here:

  * `Plugin` integration where clixon handles all user interaction with the interaction with the base system with backend plugins. This is the primary Clixon usage model.
  * `Client` integration where the base system uses clixon primarily for configurations as a "side-car". There is some ongoing work to make Clixon also work for this usage.

Plugin integration

This describes how to integrate a base system with clixon using plugins.

The Clixon architecture consists of a backend daemon with
configuration datastores and a set of internal clients: cli, restconf
and netconf.

The clients provide frontend interfaces to users of the system, such
as a Network Management System (NMS) or just a live user. The
external interfaces includes interactive CLI, RESTCONF over HTTP/HTTPS, and XML
NETCONF over TCP or SSH.  Internally, the clients and backend
communicate over Inter-Process Communication (IPC) bus via NETCONF
over a UNIX socket. It is possible to run over an INET socket as well.

The backend manages a configuration datastore and implements a
transaction mechanism for configuration operations (eg, create, read,
update, delete) . The datastore supports candidate, running and
startup configurations.

A system integrating Clixon using plugins, typically starts with a set
of YANG specifications that should be implemented. You then write
backend plugins that interact with the base system. The plugins
are written in C using the Clixon API and a set of plugin
callbacks. The main callback is a transaction callback, where you
specify how configuration changes are made to your system.

You can also design an interactive CLI using `CLIgen
<http://www.cligen.se>`_, where you specify the CLI commands and write
CLI plugins.  You will have to write CLI rules, but Clixon can
generate the configuration part of the CLI, including set, delete, show
commands for a specific syntax.
   
Notifications are supported both for CLI, netconf and restconf clients, sometimes referred to as "streams".

Client integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a client architecture, the base system keeps existing APIs and
only YANG-based configurations are exposed via Clixon. The base system
acts as a clixon client and uses the clixon client module to subscribe
to configuration events using Netconf message passing.

In comparison, the tighter plugin architecture uses dynamically loaded plugins, callbacks and a shared datastore. See :ref:`clixon client api<client_api>` for more details.
