Pagination
==========

.. This is a comment

Pagination and scrolling is the technique of showing large amount of data in smaller
chunks. Pagination was introduced in Clixon 5.3. Expect further development and changes.

Overview
--------

The pagination protocol is loosely based on `<https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-wwlh-netconf-list-pagination-nc-01.html>`_ and others for lists and leaf-lists.

The pagination in Clixon is currently restricted to the `offset` and `limit` attributes. For example, the following requests a list of 120 items in chunks of 20::

   get offset=0 limit=20
   get offset=20 limit=20
   ...
   get offset=100 limit=20

This is referred to as `stateless` pagination, since the state may
change between "get" calls. For paging of a consistent snapshot view,
consider `locked` pagination.

Clixon pagination encompasses several aspects:

1. Locked pagination
2. NETCONF/RESTCONF protocol extensions
3. CLI scrolling
4. Plugin state API

   
Locked pagination
-----------------

Using NETCONF, one can lock the datastore during a session to ensure that the data
is unchanged, such as::

   lock-db
   get offset=0 limit=20
   get offset=20 limit=20
   ...
   get offset=100 limit=20
   unlock-db

The use of locks guarantees a consistent view (snapshot) of the state
data, but ultimately needs to be implemented by the pagination plugin
code. Clixon provides a framework, but the semantics must be implemented
by the plugin.

   
Pagination protocol
-------------------

In a RESTCONF a pagination request looks as follows::
   
   GET /localhost/restconf/data/example-social:members/uint8-numbers?offset=20&limit=10 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/yang-collection+json

In NETCONF a similar request is::

   <rpc>
      <get>
         <filter type="xpath" select="/es:members/es:uint8-numbers" xmlns:es="http://example.com/ns/example-social"/>
         <list-pagination xmlns="http://clicon.org/clixon-netconf-list-pagination">true</list-pagination>
   	 <offset xmlns="http://clicon.org/clixon-netconf-list-pagination">20</offset>
	 <limit xmlns="http://clicon.org/clixon-netconf-list-pagination">10</limit>
      </get>
   </rpc>

In return, Clixon returns a reply with the requested number of entries (in NETCONF)::

   <rpc-reply>
      <data>
         <members xmlns="http://example.com/ns/example-social">
	    <member>
	       <member-id>alice</member-id>
	       <privacy-settings>
	          <post-visibility>public</post-visibility>
	       </privacy-settings>
	       <favorites>
	          <uint8-numbers>20</uint8-numbers>
  	          <uint8-numbers>21</uint8-numbers>
                  ...
    	          <uint8-numbers>29</uint8-numbers>
	       </favorites>
	    </member>
	 </members>
      </data>
   </rpc-reply>


CLI scrolling
-------------

CLIgen has a scrolling mechanism that can be integrated with pagination. For example, showing the list from the example above::

   clixon_cli
   cli> show state /es:members/es:member[es:member-id=\'bob\']/es:favorites/es:uint64-numbers cli
   uint64-numbers 0
   uint64-numbers 1
   ...
   uint64-numbers 9
   --More--

CLI callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CLI scrolling is implemented by the `cligen_output` function similar
to `printf` in syntax. By using cligen_output for all output, CLIgen
ensures a scrolling mechanism.

Clixon includes an example CLI callback function that combines
the scrolling mechanism of the CLI with NETCONF pagination called
`cli_pagination` with the following arguments:

- `xpath` : XPath of a leaf-list or list
- `prefix` : Prefix used in XPath (only one can be specified)
- `namespace` : Namespace associated with prefix
- `format` : one of xml, text, json, or cli
- `limit` : Number of lines of the pagination window

In the main example, cli_pagination is called as follows::
  
   show state <xpath:string> cli, cli_pagination("", "es", "http://example.com/ns/example-social", "cli", "10");


An application can use the `cli_pagination` callback, or create a
tailor-made CLI callback based on the example callback.


Backend pagination API
----------------------

While pagination of config data is built-in, state data needs backend plugin
callbacks. There is a special state pagination callback API where a
callback is bound to an xpath, and is called when a pagination request is made on an xpath.

Such a callback is registered with an XPath and a callback as follows::

   clixon_pagination_cb_register(h, mycallback, "/myxpath", myarg);

where the callback has the following signature::

   int 
   mycallback(void            *h,
              char            *xpath,
	      pagination_data  pd,
	      void            *arg)

The ``pd`` parameter has the following accessor functions::

   uint32_t pagination_offset(pagination_data pd)
   uint32_t pagination_limit(pagination_data pd)
   int      pagination_locked(pagination_data pd)
   cxobj*   pagination_xstate(pagination_data pd)

Essentially, the state callback requests state data for list/leaf-list `xpath` in the interval `[offset...offset+limit]`.

If `locked` is true, the plugin can cache the state data, return
further requests from the same cache until the lock on the "runn√≠ng"
database is released, thus forming an (implicit) transaction.  For
this, the ca_lockdb callback can be used as an end to the transaction.
Note that there is not explicit "start transaction", the first locked
pagination request acts as one.



See a detailed example in the main example.
