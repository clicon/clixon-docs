*******************
Event notifications
*******************

Overview
========

Clixon implements RFC 5277 NETCONF Event Notifications.

There are no pre-existing notification streams in Clixon, an application needs to define them in YANG and write some code.

The main example illustrates an EXAMPLE stream notification that triggers every 5s.

Configure options
-----------------
CLICON_STREAM_DISCOVERY_RFC5277
   Enable event stream discovery as described in RFC 5277. This is the main option and should be ``true``.
CLICON_STREAM_DISCOVERY_RFC8040
   Enable monitoring information, including streams, for RESTCONF
CLICON_STREAM_URL
   URL for locating event stream
CLICON_STREAM_RETENTION
   Retention for stream replay buffers in seconds
CLICON_STREAM_PUB
   NCHAN event publication. Obsolete

Restrictions
------------
Limited replay support

Components
==========

This section describes which components are involved to add a new event notification stream in Clixon.

To create a new event notification, you need to define the following:

1. `YANG`: Define a schema event spec
2. `Backend`: and send server-side event messages
3. `CLI`: Subscribe to the event-stream, read and display events

YANG
----
The first step is to add an event notification in YANG. The notification statement is a part of the `YANG specification <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7950.html#section-7.16>`_

The main example defines an event notification following event which is also used in RFC8040 and RFC5277::

   notification event {
      description "Example notification event.";
      leaf event-class {
         type string;
         description "Event class identifier.";
      }
      container reportingEntity {
         description "Event specific information.";
         leaf card {
            type string;
         }
      }
      leaf severity {
         type string;
      }
   }

You can add any info to an event notifcation, the fields above are just examples.

Backend
-------
The server-side first declares an event-stream, for example event ``my-event``::

   stream_add(h, "my-event", "Example notification event, 0, NULL)

Then, code needs to be added to generate event. This is highly application dependent.

Typically, events are either timer-based or event-based.

The main example uses a timer-based event, that is, a periodic timer is set that generates a periodic event.

One can also create an event-based event that triggers on things like commits or logs. Typically this code is added in applicatin user code.

You create a NETCONF notification event in XML, for example::

  <my-event xmlns="urn:myuri...">
    <data-for-this-event>....
  </my-event>

And then, assuming ``msg`` is a string variable with the notification, you send it with::

   stream_notify(h, "my-event", msg)

CLI
---
You need to register a new socket "s"::

   int s;
   clicon_rpc_create_subscription(h, "my-event", NULL, &s)


Save the asynchronous socket "s" and read from it separately.

There are some examples on how to do this in the clixon main example and the controller, eg here: https://github.com/clicon/clixon-controller/blob/9a3ef161106207f6a49f3fbc14e50841f20f50e3/src/controller_cli_callbacks.c#L431
But it depends on how you want the CLI to behave.

Netconf
-------
To start a notification stream via netconf::

   <rpc><create-subscription xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netmod:notification"><stream>EXAMPLE</stream></create-subscription></rpc>]]>]]>
   <rpc-reply><ok/></rpc-reply>]]>]]>
   <notification xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0"><eventTime>2019-01-02T10:20:05.929272</eventTime><event><event-class>fault</event-class><reportingEntity><card>Ethernet0</card></reportingEntity><severity>major</severity></event></notification>]]>]]>


Restconf
--------
An example using curl::

  curl  -X GET -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Connection: keep-alive" https://thehost/streams/


Main example
============

The main example has an integrated CLI event notification. To try out::

  clixon_cli -f /usr/local/etc/clixon/example.xml
  cli> notify
  cli> event-class fault;
  reportingEntity {
    card Ethernet0;
  }
  severity major;

  cli> no notify
  cli>
